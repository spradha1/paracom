# Paracom

  This is just an attempt to replicate a simple game I remember playing in a Windows computer in the '90s. I still can't remember the exact name of it.

## Installation

  Download the project and open the 'index.html' file in your favorite browser.

## Gameplay

  The bricks are randomized every game. There can be maximum of 35 bricks. You know the rest!

## Tech stack

  This project required nothing but HTML, CSS, and plain JavaScript.

## Future developments

  Once I make it responsive for smaller devices, I will host it. Currently the grid size is 780px x 500px. So, I suggest to run it on a suitable screen size.
